title: Life as a tech lead
---

I've been working with my current employer for almost 2 years. I joined as a mobile app developer and was promoted to a senior developer and now tech lead, in a relatively short period of time. It's been quite a crazy journey. I went from having little responsibility to managing a client who's yearly turnover is billions of dollars! I guess I must be doing something right if my current employer has so much trust in me lol.

It's hard, it's definitely outside of my comfort zone, but it has to be done.
