title: Hello World!

Insert generic "New Year, New Me" here. Just kidding, hopefully this time I will get the chance to post more frequently! :D 

I decided to move from WordPress to [Hexo.io](https://hexo.io/), which is a small NodeJS based blogging framework. I can now write posts in Markdown and generate static HTMLs, which I decided to host on Github. No need to pay for a DigitalOcean server anymore. Genius! :D
