<p>A lot of people, including myself, spend all day sitting in front of a computer screen with hardly any breaks in between. That’s not what our bodies were designed to do. Sitting for a long period of time is really bad for our health. According to Dr David Agus, <strong><em>sitting for five hours or more has the same effect on the body as smoking a whole pack of cigs..</em></strong> yeah, just read the last sentence again and let that sink in..</p>
<p>This also applies to “active couch potatoes”, people that exercise every day at a specific time, such as in the morning before work. Even if you spend an hour or two actively at the gym and then sit for the rest of your work day, you’re still affected by this. <strong><em>Daily exercise before or after work doesn’t cancel out the risks of sitting the whole day in front of a computer.</em></strong></p>
<p>So what are you supposed to do? Well, there are a few options you have but I will mention one specific thing. Stand up after every 20-30 minutes. That’s it, it’s that simple.</p>
<p>According to studies, simply standing up for about a minute is enough. You don’t even have to walk, just standing at your place for at least a minute is all that’s necessary. It’s like pushing a reset button on your body to avoid the negative side effects of an office job (or studying/watching tv all day).</p>
<p>This is what motivated me to create <strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/healthful-work-smart-not-hard!/id970747415?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="external">Healthful</a></strong>, it’s an app that will remind you to stand up after a certain amount of time has passed. Instead of just another generic reminder app, I’ve aimed it specifically at people who sit most of their time throughout the day (like me).</p>
<p>It also has a section which can be configured to schedule reminder for drinking a glass of water. This will help you to stay hydrated, focused and get you through your day. It works for me to drink at least 3 liters of water every day. Oh and you can even configure the app to only send you reminders when you’re actually at your work place! </p>

<p>I decided to move from WordPress to <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo.io</a>, which is a small NodeJS based blogging framework. I can now write posts in Markdown and generate static HTMLs, which I decided to host on Github. No need to pay for a DigitalOcean server anymore. Genius! :D</p>
